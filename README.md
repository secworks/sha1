## Implementation status ##

The core has been completed and been used in several designs. It is
considered mature and ready to use.. Minor changes are non-functional
cleanups of code.


## Introduction ##
Verilog implementation of the SHA-1 cryptgraphic hash function. The
functionality follows the specification in NIST FIPS 180-4.

The implementation is iterative with one cycle/round. The initialization
takes one cycle. The W memory is based around a sliding window of 16
32-bit registers that are updated in sync with the round processing. The
total latency/message block is 82 cycles.

There are top level wrappers that provides interface for easy
integration into a System on Chip (SoC). This interface contains mesage
block and digest registers to allow a host to load the next block while
the current block is being processed.

The implementation also includes a functional model written in Python.


## Implementation details ##

The sha1 design is divided into the following sections.
- src/rtl - RTL source files
- src/tb  - Testbenches for the RTL files
- src/model/python - Functional model written in python
- doc - documentation (currently not done.)
- toolruns - Where tools are supposed to be run. Includes a Makefile for
building and simulating the design using [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/)

The actual core consists of the following files:
- sha1_core.v - The core itself with wide interfaces.
- sha1_w_mem.v - W message block memort and expansion logic.

The top level entity is called sha1_core. This entity has wide
interfaces (512 bit block input, 160 bit digest). In order to make it
usable you probably want to wrap the core with a bus interface.

Unless you want to provide your own interface you therefore also need to
use a top level wrapper. There is one wrapper provided:
- sha1.v - A wrapper with a 32-bit memory like interface.

The core (sha1_core) will sample all data inputs when given the init
or next signal. the wrappers provided contains additional data
registers. This allows you to load a new block while the core is
processing the previous block.


## FuseSoC
This core is supported by the
[FuseSoC](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc) core package manager and
build system. Some quick  FuseSoC instructions:

Install FuseSoC
~~~
pip install fusesoc
~~~

Create and enter a new workspace
~~~
mkdir workspace && cd workspace
~~~

Register sha512 as a library in the workspace
~~~
fusesoc library add sha512 /path/to/sha512
~~~
...if repo is available locally or...
...to get the upstream repo
~~~
fusesoc library add sha512 https://github.com/secworks/sha512
~~~

Run tb_sha512 testbench
~~~
fusesoc run --target=tb_sha512 secworks:crypto:sha512
~~~

Run with modelsim instead of default tool (icarus)
~~~
fusesoc run --target=tb_sha512 --tool=modelsim secworks:crypto:sha512
~~~
